Explanation of the Code

Import Modules: We import threading, queue, and time. The queue module helps manage tasks based on priority.

Task Function: The task function simulates a task that takes some time to complete. It prints when the task starts and when it finishes.

Worker Function: The worker function runs in separate threads. It retrieves tasks from the priority queue and processes them.

Priority Queue: We create a PriorityQueue where tasks can be added with a priority level. A lower number means a higher priority.

Creating Worker Threads: We start several worker threads that will run the worker function.

Adding Tasks: We add tasks to the priority queue with different priorities.

Waiting for Completion: The main thread waits for all tasks to finish by calling priority_queue.join().

Stopping Workers: After all tasks are done, we send a signal (None) to each worker thread to indicate they should exit.
